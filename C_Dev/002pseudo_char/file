Sometimes, because of the speed and buffer capacity of the tty hardware, not all
characters requested by the writing program can be sent at the moment the write
function is called. The write function should return the number of characters that
was able to be sent to the hardware (or queued to be sent at a later time), so that the
user program can check if all of the data really was written. It is much easier for this
check to be done in user space than it is for a kernel driver to sit and sleep until all of
the requested data is able to be sent out. If any errors happen during the write call, a
negative error value should be returned instead of the number of characters that were
written.
The write function can be called from both interrupt context and user context. This
is important to know, as the tty driver should not call any functions that might sleep
when it is in interrupt context. These include any function that might possibly call
schedule, such as the common functions copy_from_user, kmalloc, and printk. If you
really want to sleep, make sure to check first whether the driver is in interrupt con-
text by calling in_interrupt.
